# Test Notebook

This directory contains notebooks for testing.


The [pytorch_assert_equal.ipynb](pytorch_assert_equal.ipynb) and
[tensorflow_assert_equal.ipynb](tensorflow_assert_equal.ipynb) contain test to
check if both implementations give the same results. They were created them to hunt
a bug in the tensorflow implementation.

The [pytorch_README.ipynb](pytorch__README.ipynb) and
[tensorflow_README.ipynb](tensorflow__README.ipynb) contain the examplary code
in the README and should ensure the code actually runs.
